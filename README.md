# 🐍 Hangman Game

Welcome to my very first Python project — a simple **Hangman game**!  
This project was made for fun and learning purposes, and it's a great way to practice basic Python concepts like:

- File handling  
- Loops and conditions  
- User input  
- String manipulation  
- Randomization

## 🎮 How to Play

1. When the game starts, it randomly selects a word from a `words.txt` file.
2. You'll see blanks (`_`) representing each letter in the word.
3. You have **chances** to guess the word by entering letters or the full word.
4. Each wrong letter reduces one chance.
5. The game ends when you guess the word or run out of attempts.
